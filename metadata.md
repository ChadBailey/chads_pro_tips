# Metadata

At the beginning of each markdown file you might see comments in the format of 
`[comment]: # (comment contents)`. These specify the rules of that particular 
document which may override the defaults. If these are not present in a file, 
the defaults in this file will be used.

You may view the raw version of this file to view them, but for easier reading 
I will include them here:

- Intended to use Github markdown processing rules
- Line width should not exceed 80 for pleasant terminal reading
- Except when the content is a URL or other continuous data stream
- When content exceeds 80 char threshold, put the data stream on its own line
- Here is an example of a max-width line (note that this exceeds 80 chars in  
markdown in order to visually simulate the 80 char width)
