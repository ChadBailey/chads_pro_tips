# Chad's Pro Tips (Key Take-Aways)

This repo is intended to be a collection of concise documentation that includes key take-aways from lessons learned when doing certain things.

This is as much for my own use as it is others' use. I will add to it as I find new key takeaways for things I encounter. Please do not consider this in any way authoritative or complete. Use at your own risk, these tips may be incomplete or just outright wrong in some instances.

# Intention & Vision

These documents should...

- Be short and to the point
- Not depend on reading of externally linked references
- Have no external dependencies
- Useful from the terminal
- Have pictures, but not depend on them for comprehension.
